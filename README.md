# First-Project
I have used HTML5 semantic elements for grouping content e.g. <header>, <article>, and <aside>
My HTML must pass validation
My CSS must pass validation
My  site must use one of these layout: multicolumn with floats, flexbox, or CSS grid.
I have used more than 3 images
I have deploy my site to git hub
My site is optimized for at least 2 viewports (a full-screen device as well as a mobile device). See below
